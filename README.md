# Interactive Photo Gallery

This repository contains a small static web page that demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in creating webpages that are both visually appealing and responsive on multiple devices.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository locally.
2. Proceed to the `src` folder.
3. Open `index.html` in any popular web browser.

## Content

The web page consists of four different images that equally share the full size of the screen. By hovering over any particular image, some transformations occur. The page is also optimized for mobile devices, with rendering of the images adjusted to be more compatible and appealing for smaller screen sizes.
